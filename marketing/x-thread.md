**Tweet 1 (Hook)**

I built a one-click installer for OpenClaw AI agent.

No terminal. No npm. No config files.

Download → Run → Enter API key. Done.

🧵 Here's why I built it and what I learned ↓

**Tweet 2 (Problem)**

OpenClaw is an amazing open-source AI agent that runs on Telegram.

But setting it up means:

- Installing Node.js
- Running npm commands
- Editing JSON config files
- Managing a gateway process

I kept seeing people give up at step 2.

**Tweet 3 (Solution)**

So I built ClawLite — a desktop app that handles everything.

It auto-detects your environment, installs dependencies, configures your AI provider (Anthropic / Gemini / OpenAI / MiniMax / GLM), and sets up Telegram.

Works on macOS and Windows.

**Tweet 4 (Technical challenge)**

The hardest part? Windows support.

OpenClaw runs inside WSL, which has 6 possible states and requires a system reboot mid-install.

I built a state machine that saves your progress and resumes after reboot. IPv6 DNS issues? Fixed those too.
